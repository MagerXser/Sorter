#Sorting Manager Project

###About the Project 
This is an individual project that was design by Sparta Global in the 4th week of training where we had to create a Sorting application
which consists of 3 different types. These include BubbleSort, QuickSort and Binary Tree Sort.

The different aspects of the project to be included is to be able to implement the different object oriented principles that we have been learing
about. This can help me as a programmer be able to improve and make my code easier to read and for other to be able to follow. 

Features that the applications has is having a console where the user is able to input numbers to be able to do different functions that the 
application has been designed to do. All the sorting algorithms are timed to show how fast they are executing with the same size array/arraylist.

### Getting Started
This will help you start my project on your computer.

    ```https://github.com/MagerXser/Sorter.git```
2. Open command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) and navigate to cloned repository


### User Interface 
There is a user interface where the user is able to type the number into the console to be able to navigate through the different
functions that the applications has.
